# Introduction
Why am I writing this? Well, I want to document my journey of creating a 3D engine from scratch. This is a personal project that I've been thinking about for a while, and I finally decided to start working on it. The goal is to create a real-time 3D engine that can be used for various applications, including games, simulations, and visualizations.

# What is Real Engine?
Real Engine is a 3D engine that will be built from the ground up. The idea is to create a flexible and efficient engine that can handle complex 3D scenes, physics, and animations. I want to focus on performance and usability, making it easy for developers to create 3D applications without getting bogged down in low-level details.

# Goals
The main goals of Real Engine are:
- **Performance**: The engine should be able to render complex scenes at high frame rates.
- **Flexibility**: It should be easy to extend and customize the engine for different use cases.
- **Ease of Use**: The engine should provide a simple and intuitive API for developers.
- **Cross-Platform**: The engine should be able to run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

# Initial Steps
To get started, I will focus on the following tasks:
1. **Setting Up the Project**: I will create a new repository and set up the initial project structure.
2. **Choosing a Programming Language**: I will decide on the programming language for the engine. I am considering using C++ for its performance and control over system resources.
3. **Creating a Window**: The first step will be to create a window where the engine can render 3D content.
4. **Rendering a Triangle**: I will implement a basic rendering pipeline that can draw a simple triangle on the screen.
5. **Shipping the First Version of Demo**: Once I have a basic rendering system in place, I will create a demo and a script to build and package the engine for distribution (e.g., .exe for Windows, .app for macOS, etc.).

# Milestones
I will set up milestones to track the progress of the project.
- **Milestone 1**: Basic rendering system with a triangle.
- **Milestone 2**: Implement 2D text rendering.
- **Milestone 3**: Implement basic input handling (keyboard and mouse).
- **Milestone 4**: Add support for loading and rendering 3D models.
- **Milestone 5**: Implement a basic physics engine.

# Conclusion
This is just the beginning of the Real Engine project. In the next devblog post, I will share the progress made on the initial steps and any challenges faced along the way.
This devblog was a bit short, but I wanted to get the first one out there. I plan to write more detailed posts as the project progresses, including code snippets, architecture decisions, and performance optimizations.
